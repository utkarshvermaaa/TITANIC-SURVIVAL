# TITANIC-SURVIVAL
# INTRODUCTION
In this project i have trained the dataset using Logistic Regression and predicted the survival of passengers in the Titanic Ship.
# WORKING
1. Firstly i have cleaned the data and removed all the unwanted features in the dataset.
2. Then i have encoded the categorical data to numerical data.
3. And appplied Logistic Regression algorithm to the dataset.
# CONCLUSION
I learnt how does Logistic Regression works and how confusion matrix can help in determing our models accuracy.
